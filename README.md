# setlistbot for Discord

### Generates setlist for Billy Strings and the Grateful Dead given the date. Personal programming project utilizing API's.

Having trouble adding functionality to retrieve setlists for any artist typed in. 
Program won't pull songs from JSON despite getting data returned to the console, and 
using the same maethod to format and send the data. I'm guessing I am requesting to 
much from the setlist API? I am waiting on
setlist.fm to upgrade my API and I am hoping it resolves my issue. Next step is to 
handle errors in more detail. Would love to hear any feedback or interest in this.
