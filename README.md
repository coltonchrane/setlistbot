# Setlistbot for Discord
### Generates setlist for Billy Strings and the Grateful Dead given the date. Personal programming project utilizing API's.

Having trouble adding functionality to retrieve setlists for any artist typed in (wont pull songs from JSON despite having the same exact code from other methods), but I am waiting on
setlist.fm to upgrade my API and I am hoping it resolves my issue. Next step is to handle errors appropriately.
